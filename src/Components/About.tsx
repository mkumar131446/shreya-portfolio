        I’m Shreya Chauhan, a Data Analytics professional with a Master’s in Information Systems from Pace University. 
        I specialize in exploring and analyzing large datasets to discover insights and trends, 
        and I love creating dashboards with Tableau and Power BI to make data tell a story. 
        I bring a strong foundation in tools like Python, R, SQL, and Excel — blending technical know-how with business insights.
